### About
This is my favorite dish from my childhood, every time I'm home my Mother prepares this dish, at least once. With her blessings I sought to re-create this dish baking instead of frying.

### Learnings
1. Soaking chicken in buttermilk ensures that the chicken will stay juicy through baking.
2. I dusted these with panko to get the same crunch as frying.
